### Google Search Console

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> a.k.a. Google Webmaster Tools
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Provides a full report of AMP indexing and errors

Note:

Once your implementation is live, you'll want to keep your eye on Google's Search Console (formerly Webmaster Tools).

Provides a list of any validation/structured data errors, with relevant links.

Keep in mind, the earlier you can catch this (ideally BEFORE it's indexed), the better!
