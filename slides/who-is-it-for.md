### Who is it for?

* Journalists, blogs, and other news sites <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Sites with heavy page weights <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

As it stands now, AMP is really kind of targeted at news sites.

Not yet a ranking factor in Google, but the consumer trust in "AMP loads fast" should not be discounted as the platform rolls out.

May not be the best investment for every client at this point, but can be effective for those who need a leg-up.
