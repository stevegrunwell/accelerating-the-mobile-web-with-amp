### Integrating with Yoast SEO

* [Glue for Yoast SEO & AMP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/glue-for-yoast-seo-amp/)
	* Override default Schema.org information with that generated by Yoast
* Automatically connects MonsterInsights (formerly Google Analytics by Yoast)

Note:

Since AMP is still relatively new, Yoast has opted to release this as an add-on plugin, though it will likely someday land in Yoast SEO
