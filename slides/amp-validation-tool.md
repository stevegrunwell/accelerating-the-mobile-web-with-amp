### AMP Validation Tool

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Validation tool built right into the AMP library
	* Just add `#development=1` to the URL
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Exposes common implementation errors within the markup
	* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> [AMP Validation Errors](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/validation_errors.html)

Note:

Fortunately, we can catch a lot of low-hanging fruit before ever deploying AMP.

The AMP website has a directory of possible validation errors, along with solutions.
