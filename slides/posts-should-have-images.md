### AMP <3s images

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> The benefits of AMP are really only apparent to publishers that use images in their media
	* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Technical blogs may suffer
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Consider free stock photos, Creative Commons-licensed images, etc.
	* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Be sure to read the licenses!

Note:

One of the biggest drawbacks I've seen while implementing AMP is that it's very biased towards sites that use image.

My site, for instance, is largely text. Even my "logo" is text. That makes it difficult to get the full AMP effect.

As a result, I've turned to sites like Unsplash and other free image sources to spice up my shares + AMP
